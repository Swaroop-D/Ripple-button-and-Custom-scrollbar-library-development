# Rippllino ‚Ä¢ A full basket of highly creative buttons_development

Are you tired of styling buttons and handling css errors for them? Then, we've got you're back.. A simple solution for creative button is hereüòç

## How to use v0.1.1@aplha

Link the `rippllino.js` to your `.html` page and init the Rippll by using the following JS in the `script` tag: -

`let rippllino = new Rippllino({ });`

Additional options supported by now: -

`let rippllino = new Rippllino({ rplThemeColor: #ffffff, rippllinoAnimateOn: 'mousedown', animationDuration: 0.75 });`

### Simple note

`rplThemeColor`, `rippllinoAnimateOn`, `animationDuration` support appropriate values and hence are user-custom. (if the values are not defined, the ripple will work just fine at all default properties)

## After doing the steps mentioned above

In your html page, add `data-rippllino="true"` tag to your html `button` or/and `a`. But, for now, make sure that you've proper styles to your buttons/a in the html in order to add ripples to it...
